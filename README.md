Personal Finance Tracker project is to empower individuals to effectively manage their personal finances with great tools and capabilities. This platform will provide users to take control of their financial activities, monitor their financial health, and can track their expenses and income. With the help of this platform, a user can understand their financial position, and identify areas of improvement, so that they can make informed decisions about their spending and saving habits.

The Personal Finance Tracker aims to simplify financial management for users. This application will provide users with a user-friendly platform where users can input their income and expenses, users can categorize transactions, and can uncover patterns in spending behaviors. This platform provides a Data Categorisation that will give users a clear picture of where their money is going, this aids identifying areas for potential budget adjustments.

Visual Analytics: Add pie charts, bar graphs, and other visual representations of the userâ€™s financial status to make it more user-friendly.
Automated Expense Categorization: Integrate with APIs (like Plaid or Yodlee) to fetch bank transactions automatically and categorize expenses.
Budgeting Feature: Implement a budgeting feature where users can set a budget for different categories and receive alerts when they are approaching the budget limits.
